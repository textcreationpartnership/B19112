            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS by the Orders Military established by Us, for the better Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Our Army, it is in the first place strictly commanded (under the penalties therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed) that no man shall presume to Blasphem, nor use unlawfull Oathes, Execrations, or any Scandalous Acts in derogation of the Honour of God; nor shall wilfully absent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from Sermons, and morning and Evening-Prayers: Notwithstanding which We have, to Our great Griefe, and high Displeasure, observed a generall Liberty taken in the breach of the said Orders, which cannot but provoke Gods Judgements to be powred out upon them, and this Nation. For prevention whereof, We do straitly charge and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all the respective Officers of Our Army, to cause all Articles established against Blasphemy, Oathes, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, Whoredom, and all other scandalous Actions, in derogation of the Service of God; as likewise for the neglect of frequenting Divine Service and Sermons, to be duly and severely put in Execution, and to cause all persons offending against any of them, to be punished as their offences shall deserve, and the Articles direct, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out favour or partiality; as they, or any of them will answer the contrary. And to the end the Service of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God may be duely celebrated, (Whereby We must expect a blessing upon Our Army and their undertakings) Our expresse Will and Command is, That the respective Chaplaines of the severall Regiments of Our Army duly attend their Callings, and continue with their Regiments duly reading twice every day Divine Service at the head of their respective Regiments (all yeelding due reverence according to the Lawes made in that behalfe) at which We require all the Officers and Souldiers of the same to be present; They to preach to them every Sunday-morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to expound some part of the Chatechisme (by Authority set forth in the Book of Common-Prayer) in the Afternoon: And to administer the Sacrament of the Lords Supper unto them the first Sunday of every Moneth. And that Our Pleasure herein be not in any sort neglected, Our Will and Command is, That Doctor <hi>Rives,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Sherwood</hi> the Chaplains Generall of Our Army, inform themselves of the Severall Chaplaines of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, and to see that every of them perform their Duties, and Our Commands herein expres'd, We expecting an Account from them of the due performance thereof. And that this may be speedily and effectually done, We do hereby give the Chaplaines Generall power to Summon the Chaplaines of Our Army to give them these Orders in charge, to require an Account of them, and to inform Us what Obedience is yeelded unto them. Further Our Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is, That the respective Chaplaines of every Regiment, or some other person appoynted by the Colonell, read publiquely every second Sunday the Military Orders, to the end every Officer, and Souldier, may the better know their Duty towards God, Us, and their Superiours. These Our Commands We require forthwith to be Printed, and published at the head of every Regiment of Our Army, and to be fully observed by all both Officers &amp; Souldiers of Our Army, as they &amp; every of them will avoyd Our high displeasure for their neglect of all, or any part of them.</p>
